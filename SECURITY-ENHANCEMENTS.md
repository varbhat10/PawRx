# PawRx Security Enhancements

## 🔒 Critical Security Issue Fixed: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

### **Problem Identified**
The application was vulnerable to IDOR attacks where authenticated users could potentially:
- Access other users' pet information by guessing/enumerating pet IDs
- Modify data belonging to other users
- Extract sensitive information about pets they don't own

### **Root Cause**
1. **Predictable MongoDB ObjectIds** - Sequential/time-based IDs could be guessed
2. **Inconsistent Authorization** - Some routes used different authorization patterns
3. **Insufficient Logging** - No audit trail for unauthorized access attempts
4. **No Rate Limiting** - No protection against ID enumeration attacks

## 🛡️ **Security Enhancements Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Pet Ownership Verification**

**Before:**
```javascript
// Basic ownership check
if (pet.owner.toString() !== req.user._id.toString() && req.user.role !== 'vet') {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Not authorized' });
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Enhanced security with logging and validation
- ObjectId format validation to prevent NoSQL injection
- Detailed logging of all access attempts and failures
- Enhanced queries that check pet.isActive status
- Comprehensive audit trail with IP addresses and timestamps
- Consistent authorization across ALL pet-related endpoints
```

### **2. Comprehensive Rate Limiting**

#### **Pet Access Rate Limiting**
- **100 requests per 15 minutes** per IP/user for pet access endpoints
- **50 requests per 15 minutes** per IP/user for pet modification endpoints
- Custom key generation combining IP address and user ID
- Automatic cleanup of old request tracking

#### **Suspicious Activity Detection**
- Monitors rapid sequential requests to different pet IDs
- **20+ pet access attempts in 5 minutes** triggers temporary ban
- Logs all suspicious patterns for investigation

### **3. Security Monitoring & Logging**

#### **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
Every pet access attempt now logs:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "userId": "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3",
  "petId": "60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b4",
  "method": "GET",
  "endpoint": "/api/pets/60f7b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b3b4",
  "accessType": "owner|vet",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "success": true
}
```

#### **Security Event Monitoring**
- **🚨 Invalid pet ID format attempts** - Potential NoSQL injection
- **🚨 Pet enumeration attempts** - Accessing non-existent pets
- **🚨 Unauthorized access attempts** - Accessing pets owned by others
- **🚨 Suspicious activity patterns** - Rapid sequential access attempts
- **✅ Successful access logging** - Full audit trail for compliance

### **4. Input Validation & Sanitization**

#### **ObjectId Format Validation**
```javascript
// Validates MongoDB ObjectId format to prevent injection
if (petId && !petId.match(/^[0-9a-fA-F]{24}$/)) {
  // Log and block invalid format attempts
}
```

#### **Active Pet Filtering**
```javascript
// Only allow access to active pets
const pet = await Pet.findOne({
  _id: petId,
  isActive: true  // Prevents access to soft-deleted pets
});
```

### **5. Consistent Authorization Middleware**

All pet-related endpoints now use the **same enhanced middleware**:
- `petAccessLimiter` - Rate limiting for read operations
- `petModificationLimiter` - Stricter rate limiting for write operations  
- `protect` - JWT authentication
- `petOwnerOrVet` - Enhanced ownership verification with logging

## 🎯 **Protected Endpoints**

### **High-Risk Endpoints (Enhanced Protection)**
```
GET    /api/pets/:id                    - Single pet access
PUT    /api/pets/:id                    - Pet modification
DELETE /api/pets/:id                    - Pet deletion
GET    /api/pets/:id/dashboard          - Sensitive dashboard data
POST   /api/interactions/check          - Medication interaction data
POST   /api/interactions/ai-analysis    - AI analysis requests
```

### **Previously Vulnerable Appointment Routes (Fixed)**
```
GET    /api/pets/:id/appointments       - Now uses proper middleware
POST   /api/pets/:id/appointments       - Now uses proper middleware  
PUT    /api/pets/:id/appointments/:aid  - Now uses proper middleware
```

## 🚨 **Attack Scenarios Prevented**

### **1. Pet ID Enumeration Attack**
**Attack:** Automated requests to `/api/pets/[ID]` with sequential IDs
**Prevention:**
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15min)
- Suspicious activity detection (20+ attempts/5min = ban)
- Comprehensive logging of enumeration attempts
- ObjectId validation prevents malformed requests

### **2. Cross-User Data Access**
**Attack:** Authenticated user accessing another user's pet data
**Prevention:**
- Enhanced ownership verification with detailed logging
- Veterinarian role properly handled across all endpoints
- Active pet filtering prevents access to deleted pets
- Audit trail for all unauthorized access attempts

### **3. NoSQL Injection via Pet ID**
**Attack:** Malicious pet ID values to manipulate database queries
**Prevention:**
- Strict ObjectId format validation
- Parameterized queries
- Input sanitization and validation

## 📊 **Security Monitoring Dashboard**

### **Log Analysis Commands**
```bash
# Monitor unauthorized access attempts
grep "🚨 Unauthorized pet access" /var/log/pawrx.log

# Track enumeration attempts  
grep "🚨 Pet enumeration attempt" /var/log/pawrx.log

# Suspicious activity patterns
grep "🚨 Suspicious activity detected" /var/log/pawrx.log

# Successful access audit trail
grep "✅ Pet access granted" /var/log/pawrx.log
```

### **Security Metrics to Monitor**
- **Failed pet access attempts per hour**
- **Unique IPs attempting unauthorized access**
- **Users with high failed access rates**
- **Pet IDs being targeted in enumeration attempts**
- **Rate limiting triggers per day**

## 🔧 **Implementation Details**

### **Middleware Chain Order**
```javascript
// Proper security middleware chain
router.get('/:id', 
  petAccessLimiter,      // 1. Rate limiting
  protect,               // 2. Authentication  
  petOwnerOrVet,         // 3. Authorization + logging
  async (req, res) => {  // 4. Route handler
    // req.pet is pre-validated
    // req.securityContext contains audit info
  }
);
```

### **Security Context Added to Requests**
```javascript
req.securityContext = {
  petId,
  userId: req.user._id,
  accessType: isOwner ? 'owner' : 'vet',
  timestamp: new Date(),
  ip: req.ip
};
```

## 🚀 **Deployment Considerations**

### **Environment Variables**
No additional environment variables required - security enhancements use existing infrastructure.

### **Performance Impact**
- **Minimal overhead** - Rate limiting uses in-memory tracking
- **Database impact** - Enhanced queries have negligible performance cost
- **Logging overhead** - Console logging (should be replaced with proper logging service in production)

### **Production Recommendations**
1. **Replace console logging** with proper logging service (e.g., Winston, ELK stack)
2. **Implement Redis-based rate limiting** for distributed systems
3. **Set up monitoring alerts** for security events
4. **Regular security audit** of access logs
5. **Consider implementing CAPTCHA** for repeated violations

## 📋 **Testing the Security**

### **Test Unauthorized Access**
```bash
# Try accessing another user's pet (should fail)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER_A_TOKEN]" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/pets/[USER_B_PET_ID]
# Expected: 403 Forbidden + logged security event
```

### **Test Rate Limiting**
```bash
# Rapid requests to trigger rate limiting
for i in {1..101}; do
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
       http://localhost:5000/api/pets/[PET_ID]
done
# Expected: 429 Too Many Requests after 100 requests
```

### **Test Invalid Pet ID Format**
```bash
# Malformed pet ID
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
     http://localhost:5000/api/pets/invalid-id-format
# Expected: 400 Bad Request + logged injection attempt
```
